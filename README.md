# OpenACR
Open source advanced combat routines for FFXIV using MMOMINION. The aim is for high-quality advanced combat routines for every class.
Currently all of them cost money and I think it's a travesty considering that you've already paid for the game, and continue to pay a monthly fee for the game and bot.
Suffice to say, the creators of MMOMINION should have come up with these on their own. What was provided instead is somewhat adequate, but allows developers to
take advantage of MMOMINON users and make unprecedented amounts of money. The very devs guilty of this even pretend to be noble by claiming that they are
"taking on the burden," yet when given the opportunity to lessen the workload they won't allow anyone to see even just one of their ACRs, probably because they plan
on making a lot of money with it.

To hell with that, I say.
